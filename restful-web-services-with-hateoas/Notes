HATEOAS 

1) HATEOAS is an acronym for Hypermedia As The Engine Of Application State. Even after expanding that for you,
 it still might not mean a lot. HATEOAS is an extra level upon REST and is used to present information about 
 a REST API to a client, allowing for a better understanding of the API without the need to bring up the 
 specification or documentation. This is done by including links in a returned response and using only these 
 links to further communicate with the server.
 
2) In the response for getOneUser, we are sending a hyperlink to getAllUsers.
